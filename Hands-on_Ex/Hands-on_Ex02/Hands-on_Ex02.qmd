# **2. Beyond ggplot2 Fundamentals**

## **2.1 Overview**

In this chapter, you will be introduced to several ggplot2 extensions for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,

-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,

-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.

## **2.2 Getting started**

### **2.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries**

In this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.

-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.

-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.

-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.

Code chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, 
               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,
               tidyverse)
```

### 2.2.2 Importing data

For the purpose of this exercise, a data file called Exam_data will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.

The code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package. readr is one of the tidyverse package.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### 2.3 Beyond ggplot2

Annotation: ggrepel One of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.
