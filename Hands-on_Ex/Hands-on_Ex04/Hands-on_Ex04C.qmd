# **7  Visualising Uncertainty**

## **7.1 Learning Outcome**

Visualising uncertainty is relatively new in statistical graphics. In this chapter, you will gain hands-on experience on creating statistical graphics for visualising uncertainty. By the end of this chapter you will be able:

-   to plot statistics error bars by using ggplot2,

-   to plot interactive error bars by combining ggplot2, plotly and DT,

-   to create advanced by using ggdist, and

-   to create hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs) by using ungeviz package.

## **7.2 Getting Started**

### **7.2.1 Installing and loading the packages**

For the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:

-   tidyverse, a family of R packages for data science process,

-   plotly for creating interactive plot,

-   gganimate for creating animation plot,

-   DT for displaying interactive html table,

-   crosstalk for for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering), and

-   ggdist for visualising distribution and uncertainty.

### **7.2.2 Data import**

For the purpose of this exercise, *Exam_data.csv* will be used.

## **7.3 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods**

A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval.

xxx

**Important**

-   Don’t confuse the uncertainty of a point estimate with the variation in the sample

In this section, you will learn how to plot error bars of maths scores by race by using data provided in *exam* tibble data frame.

Firstly, code chunk below will be used to derive the necessary summary statistics.

xxxxx

**\
Things to learn from the code chunk above**

-   `group_by()` of **dplyr** package is used to group the observation by RACE,

-   `summarise()` is used to compute the count of observations, mean, standard deviation

-   `mutate()` is used to derive standard error of Maths by RACE, and

-   the output is save as a tibble data table called *my_sum*.

**Note**

For the mathematical explanation, please refer to Slide 20 of Lesson 4.

Next, the code chunk below will be used to display *my_sum* tibble data frame in an html table format.

### **7.3.1 Plotting standard error bars of point estimates**

Now we are ready to plot the standard error bars of mean maths score by race as shown below.

xxxx

### **7.3.2 Plotting confidence interval of point estimates**

Instead of plotting the standard error bar of point estimates, we can also plot the confidence intervals of mean maths score by race.

xxx

### **7.3.3 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates with interactive error bars**

In this section, you will learn how to plot interactive error bars for the 99% confidence interval of mean maths score by race as shown in the figure below.

## **7.4 Visualising Uncertainty: ggdist package**

-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/index.html) is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.

-   It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:

    -   for frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”));

    -   for Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).

### **7.4.1 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods**

In the code chunk below, [`stat_pointinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_pointinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

xxxxx

**\
Note**

This function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.

For example, in the code chunk below the following arguments are used:

-   .width = 0.95

-   .point = median

-   .interval = qi

    xxxx

**Your turn**

Makeover the plot on previous slide by showing 95% and 99% confidence intervals.

Gentle advice: This function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.

### **7.4.3 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods**

In the code chunk below, [`stat_gradientinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_gradientinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

xxx

Gentle advice: This function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.

## **7.5 Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)**

### **7.5.1 Installing ungeviz package**

xxx

Note: You only need to perform this step once.

### **7.5.2 Launch the application in R**

xxx

### **7.5.3 Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)**

Next, the code chunk below will be used to build the HOPs.
